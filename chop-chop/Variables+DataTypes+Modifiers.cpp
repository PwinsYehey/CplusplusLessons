    // When you declare a variable, you give it a name, specify its data type, and allocate memory for it.

        // Here's how you declare and use variables in C++:

            // Variable initialization: variable_name = value;
                xx = 24;


            // Combining declaration and initialization: data_type variable_name = value;
                int x = 24; // assignment na tawag niya kapag binago natin value niya after initialize
                int y = 25;
                int sum = x + y;
